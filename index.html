                <p>Hello, my name is Scarlett.<br>
                    I am currently in my third year at Western University, 
                    pursuing a dual degree in software engineering and business.
                    Recently, I have been learning about web development within the DTTP program,
                    and this is the first assignment! I also attended SheHacks a couple weeks ago,
                    and learned quite a bit about CSS, which I have applied a bit here!
                </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>remember to link the css to the html</li>
                        <li>used the div tag to section each part of the website, i.e., image, text, content</li>
                        <li>used flexbox for the layout with the image on the left and content on the right</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
